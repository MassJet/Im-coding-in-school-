# Coding in school

Sometimes school is easy and you finish all your work. This repo is basically all the extra things I've done for school, whether It's a game for a teacher, or an app 
to prove your knowledge on something. Coding in school is the best thing to do if you like coding, and you're bored. Personally, the online editor I use for school is
something called [Online-Python](https://www.online-python.com/). It's pretty cool and you can try it out by clicking that link or going to [online-python.com](https://www.online-python.com/).
Anyways, enjoy what I have made for school in this repo!
